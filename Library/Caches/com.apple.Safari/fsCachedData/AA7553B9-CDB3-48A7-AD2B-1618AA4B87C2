  use Google services at your own risk.  For some services, Google provides 
  tools to filter out adult sexual content, including our SafeSearch preference 
  settings (see <a href="http://www.google.com/help/customize.html#safe" target="_blank">http://www.google.com/help/customize.html#safe</a>).  In addition, 
  there are commercially available services and software to limit access 
  to material that you may find objectionable. <br>
  You agree that you are responsible for your own conduct and any Content 
  that you create, transmit or display while using Google services and 
  for any consequences thereof. You agree to use Google services only 
  for purposes that are legal, proper and in accordance with the Terms 
  and any applicable policies or guidelines.  You agree that you will not 
  engage in any activity that interferes with or disrupts Google services 
  or servers or networks connected to Google services.   To report any activity 
  or Content that may violate the Terms, please go to </font><a href="http://www.google.com/support/bin/request.py" target="_blank"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><u>http://www.google.com/support/bin/request.py</u></font></a><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">. <br>

   <br>

  <i>Entire Agreement.</i> The Terms (including any policies, guidelines 
  or amendments that may be presented to your form time to time such as 
  Program Policies and Legal Notices) constitute the entire agreement 
  between you and Google and govern your use of Google services, superceding 
  any prior agreements between you and Google for the use of Google services. 
  You also may be subject to additional terms and conditions that may 
  apply when you use or purchase certain other Google services, affiliate 
  services, third-party content or third-party software. <br>
   <br>
  <i>Choice of Law and Forum.</i> The Terms and the relationship between 
  you and Google shall be governed by the laws of the State of California 
  without regard to its conflict of law provisions. You and Google agree 
  to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located 
  within the county of Santa Clara, California. <br>
   <br>
  <i>Waiver and Severability of Terms.</i> The failure of Google to exercise 
  or enforce any right or provision of the Terms shall not constitute 
  a waiver of such right or provision. If any provision of the Terms is 
  found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties 
  nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to 
  the parties' intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other 
  provisions of the Terms remain in full force and effect. <br>

   <br>
  <i>Statute of Limitations.</i> You agree that regardless of any statute 
  or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of 
  or related to use of Google services or the Terms must be filed within 
  one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever 
  barred. <br>
  The section headings in the Terms are for convenience only and have 
  no legal or contractual effect. </font></li>
